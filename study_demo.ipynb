    "### Downloading and Navigating Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary entrypoint of the results API is the `SedaroStudyResult` class. This class offers a few methods for pulling data from scenarios. The most commonly-used method is `.get` that pulls the latest results into a new result object. If the simulation is not complete, the resulting object will indicate the status is \"Running\" and not contain full results. Alternatively, use the `.poll` method to wait for an in-progress simulation to complete and download results after. Both methods allow the user to specify a particular study if the ID is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Studies potentially contain a large amount of data, it is important to consider memory usage. A `SedaroStudyResult` will lazily load individual `SedaroSimulationResult` as they are requested and cache them in memory for future requests. The `cache` boolean argument to the `.get` and `.poll` constructors controls caching behavior. If caching is disabled, the results will be downloaded each time they are requested memory must be managed manually by the user. With caching enabled, an optional `cache_dir` argument designates an on-disk location for caching simulation result data instead of in-memory. This notebook defaults to in-memory caching.\n",
